Notes: 

1. Installation 

- Technically, we’re installing the rspec-rails library, which includes rspec-core and a
few other standalone gems.

- You’ll want to include the rspec-rails dependency
in such a way that it loads in both the Rails development and test
environments, but not the production environment. In other words, you
don’t want to run tests on your server.
